========== SETUP =======================================
Download ecceTERA from http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/MBB/download_sources/16__TERA and extract it.

Executables for Mac and Linux (64-bit) are available in the bin directory.

Alternatively, ecceTERA can be built from the source code (see below).

========== RUNNING ecceTERA =======================================

To test the installation, try running: 
bin/ecceTERA species.file=../tests/Stree.tree gene.file=../tests/HBG284008_1.gtrees 

It should return a cost of 85.

Note: run bin/ecceTERA_linux64 or bin/ecceTERA_mac instead of bin/ecceTERA if not built from source.

A description of the other program options can be found in ecceTERA.pdf.


=========== INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE CODE =========================

REQUIREMENTS
1. ecceTERA download (http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/MBB/download_sources/16__TERA)
2. Boost libraries (www.boost.org).
3. Bio++: bpp-core, bpp-phyl, and bpp-seq packages (biopp.univ-montp2.fr).
4. cmake (http://cmake.org/download/)

ecceTERA was tested with these versions.
Bio++ 2.20
Boost 1.55.0, 1.59.0

For Bio++, we recommend using the automatic installation script (http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/Download/bpp-setup.sh)
See http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/wiki/index.php/Installation for more information.


BUILDING
1. Extract the tera download.
2. cd ecceTERA/build
3. cmake ..
4. make


CMAKE PARAMETERS 

If CMake cannot find the Boost or the Bio++ libraries, try adding the following parameters to the cmake command line using the appropriate directories (assuming the bpp-phyl-2.2.0, bpp-seq-2.2.0, and bpp-core-2.2.0 are in the /home/user/local directory):

cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/home/local/user/boost -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/local/ -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/user/local/ ..

To use a g++ compiler instead of c++, append the following to the cmake command line:
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ 

If the Bio++ libraries are installed in a non-standard location, their location needs to be specified to run ecceTERA, such as with the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, e.g.:
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/user/local/bpp-core-2.2.0/src:/home/user/local/bpp-seq-2.2.0/src:/home/user/local/bpp-phyl-2.2.0/src
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
